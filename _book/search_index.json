It is hard to understate my excitement for the community to see the results. Not only is the release of the annual report this year a celebration of all the hard work of the many absolutely amazing volunteers of the Black Rock City Census, but the report this also represents a celebration of the return home for our community to the Black Rock Desert. This year also marks an important milestone for the Black Rock City Census – a decade of data (although no data was collected in 2020 and 2021). The world has changed since Burning Man 2019, and burners have changed with it. The subsequent document details in what ways we have changed and in what ways we persevered as community and remained the same. Contributions and acknowledgments BRC Census General Coordination and Scientific Committee: Andi “Sonder” Morency, Aaron “Murrs” Shev Data Analysis: Aaron “Murrs” Shev Report coordination and visiualization: Aaron “Murrs” Shev Report editing and proofreading: Technical assistance: Special thanks and acknowledgements: The XXX volunteers of the 2022 Census Lab including: research collaborators, volunteer coordinators, camp builders, gate samplers, key punchers, Census Lab hosts, graphic designers, and many more! Special thanks to Dana “DV8” DeVaul whose work on the 2018 population report was the basis for many elements in this report. We would also like to thank the Burning Man Communications Department and the Burning Man Tech Team Additionally, we would like to extend our sincere thanks to all of the Burning Man participants who have taken the time to provide their data. This project would not exist without our respondents. Finally, our thanks to Burning Man Project for the resources they provide both on playa and off playa and for believing in the project!

Although the Black Rock City (BRC) Census project is technically a survey and not a literal census (where data is collected from every member of a population), our methodology allows us to report estimates that are representative of the entire population of Black Rock City (BRC) and not just on the individuals who participate actively in our data collection efforts. While BRC Census has been producing reports since 2002, it is hard to compare recent data with reports from earlier years (before 2013) because of important differences in methodology — from a convenience sample of Census Lab visitors on-playa — to a weighted online survey conducted post-event. The results in this report are estimates of the Black Rock City population. The true population values may differ from the presented estimates due to random variation in the sampling process. This report contains estimates from data collected in 2022 and, when possible, comparable estimates from 2013 through 2018. The BRC Census project is made possible through the extensive collective effort of volunteers, academic researchers, and Burning Man Project. Our thanks to everyone whose contributions went into the creation of this report! 1.2 Survey Design Since 2013, the BRC Census team has collected data in two phases: a random sample of participants entering the Burning Man event and a more comprehensive online survey after the event. During the Burning Man event in Black Rock City, Census volunteers conduct the random sample by administering a short socio-demographic survey to randomly selected Burners who agree to participate. After the event, announcements about the online survey are sent out via email lists, social media, the Burning Man website and through other various outreach programs. Results from the online survey are biased due to self-selection of Burners choosing to participate. To adjust for this bias we choose weights for the online survey responses so that answers to key questions asked on both surveys match. 1.2.1 Random Sample The random sample is designed with a goal of surveying 5% to 10% of the population of Black Rock City in a given year. The survey collection is stratified by location participants entered Black Rock City: The main gate, the airport, or on the Burner Express Bus (a shuttle service running from San Francisco and Reno into Black Rock City). Participants are chosen in a pseudo-random fashion by skipping a pre-selected number of cars driving in through gate or participants entering on foot through the airport. Entire Burner Express Buses are randomly selected as a cluster sample. The random sample collects data on 10 questions by giving selected participants a short paper form to fill out: Day of arrival Age Number of prior Burning Man events attended English as a first language Gender US Resident or not Voting eligibility in the US US political party affiliation 1.2.2 Online Survey The online survey is live Tuesday the week following and remains available for approximately a month. The survey comprises questions in the random sample, demographic and socioeconomic questions, questions submitted by the Burning Man Organization, and questions submitted by academic researchers. Response rates for all surveys are given in the table below. ## Warning: package &#39;kableExtra&#39; was built under R version 4.2.3 Survey responses (n) BRC Population Response rate 2013 11,919 68,000 17% 2014 11,676 68,000 18% 2015 9,585 70,000 14% 2016 7,137 70,000 11% 2017 9,168 70,000 13% 2018 8,745 70,000 12% 2019 7,737 80,000 10% 2022 8,382 87,000 10% 1.2.3 Weighting Results from the online survey are weighted to adjust for selection bias. Weights are chosen so that the distribution of responses for questions that appear in both the random sample and the online survey are nearly the same through a process called post stratification or raking. For example, in 2022, the random sample estimated 28.3% of participants were vigins (attending their first burn), but only 24.1%. After weighting the online survey we also estimate 28.3% or participants are virgins.
