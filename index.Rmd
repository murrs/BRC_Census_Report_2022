# Forward {-}

It has been over three years since I last wrote the forward to a Black
Rock City population report. It is hard to understate my excitement for the
community to see the results. Not only is the release of the annual report this year a
celebration of all the hard work of the many absolutely amazing volunteers of the Black Rock City
Census, but the report this also represents a celebration of the return home
for our community to the Black Rock Desert. This year also marks an important
milestone for the Black Rock City Census -- a decade of data (although no data was collected
in 2020 and 2021). The world has changed since Burning Man 2019, 
and burners have changed with it. The subsequent document details in what
ways we have changed and in what ways we persevered as community and remained
the same.
